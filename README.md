# Jupyter Notebook for Preprocessing Nike's Social Media Comments
This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code to preprocess user-generated comments from Nike's website, blogs, and social media platforms. The goal is to clean and tokenize the text data, remove stopwords, and stem or lemmatize the words to prepare them for further analysis.
